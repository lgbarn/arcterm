# Specification Quality Checklist: Warp-Style AI UX

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass.
- US1 (compact panel) is the highest-impact change — transforms the command overlay from "overlay that hides everything" to "integrated panel that coexists with terminal."
- US2 (agent mode) is the most complex — requires prompt detection, multi-step planning, step-by-step execution, and failure handling.
- US3 (polish) depends on US1 and US2 being functional first.
